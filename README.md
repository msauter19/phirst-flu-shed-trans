These files provide a mock data set (the data is not yet public) and the code used to reproduce the model and figures from this manuscript. This mock data set only runs the model and creates figures for one subtype/lineage (A(H3N2)); all models and figures in the paper were run seperately for each of the four influenza virus subtypes/lineages observed in the real data set.
